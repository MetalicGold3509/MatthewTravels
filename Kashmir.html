        <p id="para2">Kashmir[a] is the northernmost <br/>
            geographical region of the Indian subcontinent.<br/>
             Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir" denoted<br/>
              only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and <br/>
              the Pir Panjal Range. Today, the term encompasses a larger<br/>
               area that includes the Indian-administered territories of<br/>
                Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered<br/>
                ] territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and <br/>
       Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the<br/>
        Trans-Karakoram Tract.[1][2][3]
    
            In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir <br/>
            region became an important centre of Hinduism and later<br/>
             of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir<br/>
              Shaivism arose.[4] In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim<br/>
               ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Shah Mir<br/>'
               ' dynasty.[5] Kashmir was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to<br/>
                1751,<br/>
               [6] and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani<br/>
                Empire.[5] That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed<br/>
                 Kashmir.[5] In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First<br/>
                  Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from <br/>
                  the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, <Br/>
                  Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his <br/>
                  descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British<br/>
                   Crown, lasted until the partition of India in 1947, when the former<br/>
                    princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed<br/>
                     territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan,<br/>
                      and China.[1][2]</p>
