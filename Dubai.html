            Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎, romanized:<br/>
             Dubayy [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) <br/>
             |is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)<br/>
              and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.[5][6][7]

            Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on<br/>
             the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business<br/>
              hub of Western Asia.[8] It is also a major global transport<br/>
               hub for passengers and cargo.[9] Oil revenue helped accelerate <br/>
               the development of the city, which was already a major<br>
                mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international<br/>
                 trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies <br/>
                 on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and <br/>
                 financial services.[10][11][12][13] Oil production contributed to<br/>
                  less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[14] According<br/>
                   to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around<br/>
                    3,400,800 as of 8 September 2020.[15][16]
