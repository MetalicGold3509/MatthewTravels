        <p id="para2">Himalayas in Himachal’ or one must say Himachal<br/>
            in Himalayas. ‘Him’ in Hindi literally means ice<br/>
             or snow and ‘alaya’ means home, which makes Himalayas <br/>
             ‘The Home of Snow’ and from there Himachal gets its<br/>
              name meaning ‘Land of Snow’.
           While traditionally Himachal was known as a summer<br/>
            destination, the Department of Tourism & Civil Aviation<br/>
             Government of Himachal Pradesh  has taken special efforts<br/>
              to break the seasonality factor and has developed diversified<br/>
               tourism products to attract tourists in other seasons too. Now <br/>
               Himachal is known as “A Destination for All Seasons and All Reasons”.
           
           In fact, the Department has laid a special emphasis on the development of activity-based tourism and opening up of new sub destinations. To promote tourism in the countryside and to unexplored areas, appropriate infrastructure is being developed within available resources. By focussing on quality tourists, the Department aims at promoting sustainable tourism and encouraging private sector to develop tourism related infrastructure in the State without disturbing the existing ecology and environment.</p>
